What is your plan to achieve your goal? I mean the main goal. The whole big main quest in your life. Recently I have been wondering, what if we see our life as a whole video game. Like a typical adventure game, it has missions and mini quests. Actually, the video game itself mimics real life situations. But there is a big difference between them. The ideal conditions. We can set goals, but sometimes it doesn't work out as we planned. 

The main mission. The big dream. 

As life goes on we might achieve our goals. We set a new goal after another. At some point we will find a pattern. Every individual will have their own pattern. But one important thing is consistency. Since we can't control luckiness, we can set it aside. As the pattern becomes more clear, we are more confident to set bigger goals. The bigger the goals, the more complex situations to overcome.
