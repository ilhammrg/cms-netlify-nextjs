What is your plan to achieve your goal? I mean the main goal. The whole big main quest in your life. Recently I have been wondering, what if we see our life as a whole video game. Like a typical adventure game, it has missions and mini quests. Actually, the video game itself mimics real life situations. But there is a big difference between them. The ideal conditions. We can set goals, but sometimes it doesn't work out as we planned. 

The main mission. The big game. 

As life goes on we might achieve our goals. We set a new goal after another. At some point we will find a pattern. Every individual will have their own pattern. But one important thing is consistency. Since we can't control luckiness, we can set it aside. As the pattern becomes more clear, we are more confident to set bigger goals. The bigger the goals, the more complex situations to overcome. Control the situations, manage the complexity, and finally mission accomplished. Sounds easy. Yes, theoretically.

Maybe it's not all about consistency, but inconsistency might trigger failure. People tend to back off when they fail. I think lack of motivation could trigger inconsistency. Motivation could be anything. For me, the closest people around me are the most powerful motivation. I felt that I'm able to conquer everything, which sounds lame but quite helpful, at least for me. 

In video games we're going through missions. They have correlations with each other. The whole big game. Our main goal is some kind of abstraction. Hide complexity behind every mission. The whole picture seems scary and overwhelming. Identify and split the goal, make it as an individual mission that is less complex. 

Are all of these even practical in real life scenarios? Who knows. So, are you ready for your big game?
